# Mapping portsheds
A series of international ports were provided by infrastructrue experts at the World Bank and used to calculate portsheds, representing the area that can reach a port within a defined period of time. The travel time calculations were performed using the [Global Friction Surface 2019](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/Oxford_MAP_friction_surface_2019#description), see the example below of a port in eastern India.

# Data and Results
The data and results can be found on the World Bank's Development Data Hub [here](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/int/search/dataset/0060145/International-portsheds).
